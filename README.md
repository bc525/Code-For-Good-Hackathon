## [BACKEND Pointers](BACKEND/schemas/)

**UserModel** 
+ User User Create Account **signupUser** `'/signup'`
+ User Login/SignIN **loginUser** `'/login'`
+ User Return User**getUser**
+ User Delete User Account **deleterUser** `/:id'`
+ api/user/...

**PostModel** 
+ User Create Post **createPost** `'/createPost'`
+ User Delete Post **deletePost**
+ User Get/Return Post **getPost** `'/:id'`
+ api/post/...


## Why

MongoDB! We used it's schema to create flexible and scalable [databases](BACKEND/schemas/) that can be easily implemented through [BACKEND/controllers](BACKEND/controllers/)  

React! Our challenge statement requested an application desktop and mobile friendly. React was the most popular stack among our group and we knew it would work great with MongoDB. 

Material UI! We used its open-source React component library that implements Google's Material Design to help design our application.

## Define
**Impacts** what exactly is impacted by the problem and how.
We want to remain accessible to people who dont speak english. -> translate feature
We want a UI that is easily understood and navigated by all parties (Volunteers, Admin, people in need)

**Description**  A clear and specific overview of the “current state”.
Only minimal day2day staff with limited time -> we can’t burden them with tech with a high learning curve
Struggling reaching out to younger volunteers -> storage -> easier contact/outreach 

**Constraints** Impediments to solving the problem that must be overcome
We implemented stacks that some of us are using for the first time MongoDB/Mongoose and React, {Git Branch Management :( }

**Success Criteria** How exactly will you know you have solved the problem
We intend to have a working demo and presentation
